# MSP430G-Temperature
This is a project work for my Microcontroller course. 
LM75B Temperature sensor with I2C is used.
Purpose is to get the temperature and print it on an 16x2 LCD. Program must show current temperature and average of 10 measurements. 
Normally program must show temperature contuniously but in the code it is not configured that way. Until anyone press the button it keeps showing the previous temperature. When button is pushed new temperature will be displayed on the screen. It should save the current temperature to the memory each button push.
